I'm a Junior Software Developer with a great passion for programming, I am excited to contribute to any team. I have little to zero experience using a programming language in a real-life setting, but my proficiency in Javascript, HTML, and CSS has provided me with a solid foundation to build upon. I pay attention to detail and enjoy tackling challenging problems. My desire to learn and grow in the software development field is insatiable, and I am eager to work alongside experienced professionals to further enhance my skills. I am confident that my drive and dedication will make me a valuable addition to any organization seeking an entry-level software developer.
